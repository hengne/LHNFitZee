ECAL calibration using Zee

This is a package for CMS ECAL calibration using Zee.
It started from the exiting project "FitZeeECALELF" Hengne developed during 2013-2014 tested using CMS 2012 data. Compared to "FitZeeECALELF", we have a major clean up of previous testing methods, and also reorganizing of the structure of the codes.
